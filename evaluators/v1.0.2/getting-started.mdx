<Warning>
  **This is a placeholder page** - This content is for demonstration purposes only and will be replaced with actual documentation.
</Warning>

Welcome to the Evaluators section v1.0.2! This guide will help you understand how to use our most advanced evaluation framework with AI-powered insights and real-time monitoring capabilities.

## What are Evaluators?

Evaluators are automated tools that help you:
- ‚úÖ Test model performance
- üìä Measure accuracy and reliability  
- üîç Identify potential issues
- üìà Track improvements over time
- üöÄ Batch processing support
- üìã Custom metric definitions
- ü§ñ **NEW: AI-powered evaluation insights**
- üì° **NEW: Real-time monitoring and alerts**
- üîÑ **NEW: Continuous evaluation pipelines**

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Evaluator SDK

```bash
pip install evaluator-sdk==1.0.2
```

### Step 2: Create Advanced Evaluations

<CodeGroup>
```python AI-Powered Evaluation (NEW)
from evaluator import AIEvaluator

# NEW: AI-powered evaluation with insights
ai_eval = AIEvaluator(
    name="ai-enhanced-evaluation",
    model="gpt-4",
    dataset="test-data.json",
    enable_ai_insights=True,
    insight_model="claude-3-sonnet",
    auto_recommendations=True
)

# Run with AI analysis
results = ai_eval.run_with_insights()
print(f"Accuracy: {results.accuracy}")
print(f"AI Insights: {results.insights.summary}")
print(f"Recommendations: {results.recommendations}")
```

```python Real-time Monitoring (NEW)
from evaluator import RealtimeEvaluator

# NEW: Real-time evaluation monitoring
rt_eval = RealtimeEvaluator(
    name="production-monitoring",
    model="gpt-4",
    stream_endpoint="wss://api.example.com/stream",
    alert_thresholds={
        "accuracy": 0.85,
        "latency": 2000
    }
)

# Start continuous monitoring
rt_eval.start_monitoring()
```

```python Continuous Pipeline (NEW)
from evaluator import ContinuousEvaluator

# NEW: Continuous evaluation pipeline
pipeline = ContinuousEvaluator(
    name="ci-cd-pipeline",
    model="gpt-4",
    trigger="git_push",
    auto_deploy_threshold=0.95,
    rollback_threshold=0.80
)

# Deploy with automatic evaluation gates
pipeline.deploy_with_evaluation()
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Advanced Custom Metrics with AI

```python
from evaluator.metrics import AIMetric, CustomMetric

# AI-enhanced custom metric
ai_metric = AIMetric(
    name="contextual_relevance",
    evaluator_model="gpt-4",
    prompt_template="Rate the relevance of this response: {response}",
    scale=(1, 10),
    threshold=7.0
)

# Traditional custom metric
custom_metric = CustomMetric(
    name="domain_accuracy",
    calculation=lambda pred, actual: calculate_domain_score(pred, actual),
    threshold=0.85
)

# Add both to evaluator
eval.add_metrics([ai_metric, custom_metric])
```

### Step 4: Real-time Dashboard and Alerts

Navigate to your enhanced dashboard for:
- Real-time performance monitoring
- AI-generated insights and recommendations
- Automated alert notifications
- Trend analysis and predictions
