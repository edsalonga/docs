</Warning>

Welcome to the Evaluators section! This guide will help you understand how to use our evaluation framework to test and validate your AI systems.

## What are Evaluators?

- üîç Identify potential issues
- üìà Track improvements over time

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Evaluator SDK

```bash
pip install evaluator-sdk
```

### Step 2: Create Your First Evaluation

```python
from evaluator import Evaluator

# Initialize evaluator
eval = Evaluator(
    name="sample-evaluation",
    model="gpt-4",
    dataset="test-data.json"
)

# Run evaluation
results = eval.run()
print(f"Accuracy: {results.accuracy}")
```

### Step 3: View Results

Navigate to your dashboard to see detailed results and metrics.
