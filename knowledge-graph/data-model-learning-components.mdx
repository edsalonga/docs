# Data model for learning components

This page describes the data model used to represent learning components within the knowledge graph system.

## Overview

Learning components are the fundamental building blocks of educational content. They represent discrete concepts, skills, or knowledge elements that can be combined to create comprehensive learning experiences.

## Key Components

### Learning Objective
- **Definition**: A specific, measurable learning goal
- **Properties**: Objective ID, statement, cognitive level, difficulty
- **Relationships**: Aligned to standards, contains learning activities

### Concept
- **Definition**: A fundamental idea or principle to be learned
- **Properties**: Concept ID, name, definition, subject area
- **Relationships**: Has prerequisites, enables other concepts

### Skill
- **Definition**: A procedural ability or competency
- **Properties**: Skill ID, name, type (cognitive/motor/social), proficiency levels
- **Relationships**: Builds on prerequisite skills, demonstrated through activities

### Learning Activity
- **Definition**: A specific task or exercise designed to develop understanding
- **Properties**: Activity ID, type, duration, materials needed
- **Relationships**: Targets objectives, assesses skills and concepts

### Assessment Item
- **Definition**: A question or task used to measure learning
- **Properties**: Item ID, type, difficulty, scoring rubric
- **Relationships**: Measures objectives, evaluates concept understanding

## Data Structure

```json
{
  "learningComponent": {
    "id": "algebra-linear-equations",
    "type": "concept",
    "name": "Linear Equations",
    "prerequisites": ["basic-algebra", "coordinate-plane"],
    "objectives": [...]
  }
}
```

## Relationships

Learning components form a complex web of dependencies and alignments:
- **Prerequisites**: Components that must be mastered before others
- **Supports**: Components that enable understanding of more advanced topics
- **Aligns to**: Standards that the component addresses
- **Assessed by**: Items that measure mastery of the component

## Implementation Notes

This model enables adaptive learning pathways by mapping the relationships between components and tracking student progress through the learning graph.
