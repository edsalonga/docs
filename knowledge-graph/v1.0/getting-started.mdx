# Getting Started with Knowledge Graphs

<Info>
  **You are viewing version 1.0** - This is the stable release of the Knowledge Graph documentation. For the latest features, see [version 1.1](/knowledge-graph/v1.1/getting-started).
</Info>

<Warning>
  **This is a placeholder page** - This content is for demonstration purposes only and will be replaced with actual documentation.
</Warning>

Welcome to Knowledge Graphs v1.0! This guide will help you understand how to create, manage, and query knowledge graphs to represent complex relationships in your data.

## What is a Knowledge Graph?

A knowledge graph is a network of real-world entities and their relationships, represented as:
- üîó **Entities** - People, places, concepts, or things
- ‚ÜîÔ∏è **Relationships** - How entities connect to each other
- üè∑Ô∏è **Properties** - Attributes and metadata about entities
- üìä **Schema** - Structure and rules governing the graph

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Initialize Your Knowledge Graph

```python
from knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraph

# Create a new knowledge graph
kg = KnowledgeGraph(name="my-first-kg")

# Add some entities
kg.add_entity("Alice", type="Person")
kg.add_entity("TechCorp", type="Company")
kg.add_entity("Software Engineer", type="JobTitle")
```

### Step 2: Define Relationships

```python
# Create relationships between entities
kg.add_relationship(
    source="Alice", 
    relation="works_at", 
    target="TechCorp"
)

kg.add_relationship(
    source="Alice", 
    relation="has_title", 
    target="Software Engineer"
)
```

### Step 3: Query Your Graph

```cypher
// Find all people who work at TechCorp
MATCH (person:Person)-[:works_at]->(company:Company)
WHERE company.name = "TechCorp"
RETURN person.name
```

## Example Knowledge Graph Structure

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Alice] -->|works_at| B[TechCorp]
    A -->|has_title| C[Software Engineer]
    A -->|lives_in| D[San Francisco]
    B -->|industry| E[Technology]
    B -->|founded_in| F[2010]
    C -->|part_of| G[Engineering Department]
```

## Sample Query Results

| Entity | Type | Relationships | Properties |
|--------|------|---------------|------------|
| Alice | Person | works_at, has_title, lives_in | age: 28, email: alice@example.com |
| TechCorp | Company | employs, industry, founded_in | employees: 500, revenue: $50M |
| Software Engineer | JobTitle | requires_skills, salary_range | level: Senior, remote: true |

## Common Use Cases

### üîç **Knowledge Discovery**
Find hidden patterns and connections in your data

### ü§ñ **AI & Machine Learning**
Enhance models with structured relationship data

### üìà **Recommendation Systems**
Build personalized recommendations based on graph relationships

### üîé **Search & Analytics**
Enable semantic search and complex analytical queries
