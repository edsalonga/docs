# Data model for curriculum

This page describes the data model used to represent curriculum structures within the knowledge graph system.

## Overview

The curriculum data model organizes educational content into coherent, sequential learning experiences. It defines how learning components are structured, sequenced, and delivered to achieve specific educational goals.

## Key Components

### Curriculum Framework
- **Definition**: The overarching structure that organizes learning across subjects and grade levels
- **Properties**: Framework ID, name, grade span, subject areas
- **Relationships**: Contains courses, aligns to standards

### Course
- **Definition**: A structured sequence of learning experiences in a specific subject
- **Properties**: Course ID, title, description, grade level, duration
- **Relationships**: Part of framework, contains units

### Unit
- **Definition**: A thematic grouping of lessons focused on specific learning goals
- **Properties**: Unit ID, title, essential questions, timeframe
- **Relationships**: Part of course, contains lessons, addresses standards

### Lesson
- **Definition**: A single instructional session with specific objectives
- **Properties**: Lesson ID, title, objectives, duration, materials
- **Relationships**: Part of unit, includes activities, assesses learning

### Learning Pathway
- **Definition**: A personalized sequence of learning experiences
- **Properties**: Pathway ID, student profile, adaptive rules
- **Relationships**: References curriculum elements, tracks progress

## Data Structure

```json
{
  "curriculum": {
    "id": "grade-5-math",
    "name": "Grade 5 Mathematics Curriculum",
    "courses": [
      {
        "id": "numbers-operations",
        "units": [...],
        "standards": [...]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Curriculum Relationships

The curriculum model supports multiple organizational patterns:
- **Vertical Alignment**: How concepts build across grade levels
- **Horizontal Alignment**: How subjects connect within a grade level
- **Standards Alignment**: How curriculum maps to academic standards
- **Prerequisite Mapping**: Dependencies between curriculum elements

## Personalization Features

### Adaptive Sequencing
- Dynamic reordering based on student performance
- Alternative pathways for different learning styles
- Intervention and enrichment branching

### Competency Tracking
- Mastery-based progression criteria
- Evidence collection from multiple assessments
- Learning analytics integration

## Implementation Notes

This model enables flexible curriculum delivery while maintaining coherent learning progressions. It supports both traditional scope-and-sequence approaches and competency-based education models.
