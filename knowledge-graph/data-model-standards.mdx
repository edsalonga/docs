# Data model for standards

This page describes the data model used to represent academic standards within the knowledge graph system.

## Overview

Academic standards define the learning expectations and benchmarks that guide educational content and assessment. Our data model captures the hierarchical relationships and metadata associated with various standards frameworks.

## Key Components

### Standard Framework
- **Definition**: The overarching standards system (e.g., Common Core, NGSS)
- **Properties**: Name, version, jurisdiction, subject area
- **Relationships**: Contains multiple standard domains

### Standard Domain
- **Definition**: Major subject or skill areas within a framework
- **Properties**: Domain identifier, title, description
- **Relationships**: Part of framework, contains clusters

### Standard Cluster
- **Definition**: Groups of related standards within a domain
- **Properties**: Cluster identifier, title, grade level range
- **Relationships**: Part of domain, contains individual standards

### Individual Standard
- **Definition**: Specific learning objective or expectation
- **Properties**: Standard code, statement, grade level, complexity
- **Relationships**: Part of cluster, aligned to learning components

## Data Structure

```json
{
  "framework": {
    "id": "ccss-math",
    "name": "Common Core State Standards - Mathematics",
    "version": "2010",
    "domains": [...]
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

This data model supports cross-referencing between standards and learning components, enabling alignment tracking and gap analysis across curriculum materials.
