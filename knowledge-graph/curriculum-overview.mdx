# Curriculum Overview

Curriculum represents the organized framework of educational experiences designed to achieve specific learning outcomes. Within our knowledge graph system, curriculum serves as the orchestrating layer that sequences, structures, and delivers learning components in coherent, purposeful ways.

## What is Curriculum in the Knowledge Graph?

Curriculum in our system is more than just a collection of lessons or activities. It represents:

- **Structured learning pathways** that guide student progression
- **Coherent sequences** of educational experiences
- **Standards-aligned frameworks** ensuring quality and compliance
- **Adaptive structures** that respond to individual learner needs

## Curriculum Architecture

Our knowledge graph organizes curriculum into hierarchical structures that support both traditional and innovative educational approaches:

### Curriculum Hierarchy
